# CodeAlpha_Number_Guessing_Game
implemented using C++ programming language.
A number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number and a player has to guess the number.
The game provides hints like " too high " or "too low " to help the player guess the correct number.
The main libraries to consider when implementing the game are :

#include <ctime>     // For time()
